Download the Gene Expression data from TCGA repository for Head and Neck Squamous Cell Carcinoma(HNSCC)
Clean the data 
Follow the process of preprocessing and normalisation 
Statical analysis test should be done to get the differentially expressed genes(DEG)
Map the DEG on the protein-protein interaction(PPI) data downloaded from the databases like i2d, mint
Construct and analyse the PPI network to know the key protein involved in HNSCC
